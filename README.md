# Google Foobar Prompts and Solutions

Here I document my journey through Foobar, Google's invitation-based coding challenge. While I normally would be opposed to publicizing such information in a GitHub repository, many before me have done similarly across GitHub, StackOverflow, and much more--so I do not feel as though I'm "spoiling" anything.

I have written walkthroughs of each of the solutions I came to, trying to elaborate on how the algorithms were achieved. Having seen others' solutions for these problems, I know that mine are not unique, but perhaps my explanations of how I came to the proper end could be illuminating for fellow folks on their programming journeys.

Thanks for reading!
